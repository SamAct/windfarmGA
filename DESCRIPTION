Title: Genetic Algorithm to optimize a Wind Farm Layout Problem
Version: 0.1
Date: 2016-12-15
Author: Sebastian Gatscha
Maintainer: Sebastian Gatscha <sebastian_gatscha@gmx.at>
Description: The package includes a genetic algorithm, which is designed to optimize
    small wind farms up to 50 turbines. The algorithm works with a fixed amount of turbines,
    a fixed rotor radius and a mean wind speed value for every incoming wind direction.
    If required it can include a terrain effect model, which includes an SRTM elevation model
    that is downloaded automatically, and a CCL raster, which has to be downloaded and adapted
    previously. Further information can be found at the following link.
